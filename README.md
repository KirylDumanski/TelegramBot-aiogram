## Ger your own credentials

### Obtain Your Telegram Bot Token
In this context, a token is a string that authenticates your bot (not your account) on the bot API.
Each bot has a unique token which can also be revoked at any time via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

Obtaining a token is as simple as contacting [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), issuing the `/newbot` command
and following the steps until you're given a new token. You can find a step-by-step guide
[here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot).

Your token will look something like this:
```
